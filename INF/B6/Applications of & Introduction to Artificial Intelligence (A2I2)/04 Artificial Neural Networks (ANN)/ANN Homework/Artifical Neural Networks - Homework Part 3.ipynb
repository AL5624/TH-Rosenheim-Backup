    "# Introduction\n",
    "After watching the video in part 2 of the homework, you have a basic idea about how ANNs work. What you still do not know is how to set all these thousands or millions of parameters programmatically. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you think back about the very first lecture, you may remember that most machine learning methods consist of three parts: a model, a training algorithm and a model evaluation algorithm. In the case of ANN, \n",
    "* the **model** is the structure chose (number of hidden layers, number of neurons, activation function, etc.) and the set of weights (incl. the biases). \n",
    "* the **model evaluation algorithm** is the computation shown in the video in part 2 of the homework - starting at the input layer, computing all the matrix multiplications and squishification functions (we call them activation functions, mostly because squishification function is reall hard to type!) and outputting the values of the output layer. This is the so called \"feed forward\" algorithm.\n",
    "* the **training algorithm** for a neural network has to compute all the weights (and biases) - naturally, this is hard, as there are so many of them. The most widely used algorithm is called \"backpropagation\" (backprop for short), and you will learn about the underlying idea and the algorithm in the two videos in the part 3 of the homework"

    "\n",
    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition, natural language understanding, and natural language generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: NLP is not to be confused with 'Neuro-linguistic programming', which is also abbreviated as NLP but \"[...]has been discredited as a pseudoscience\" [<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming\">wikipedia.com</a>].\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework you will be watching a couple of videos by Dan Jurafsky and Christopher Manning, introducing you to the basic concepts of NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For each video, first watch the whole video, than try to answer the questions (in German or English, your choice). If you cannot answer one of the questions, re-watch the full video and try to answer the question in your own words once again. Do not simply write down the answers WHILE watching the video (doing so has very little learning impact).**"
